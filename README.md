# Titanic-Survivor-Predictor
Preprocessed a large, corrupted dataset and trained a supervised machine learning model (logistic regression) to classify whether passengers would survive. Utilized scikit-learn and pandas.

Used pre processing techniques to handle missing values, duplicate values, incorrect types, incompatible types, and further skills to determine what data was important to include in model.
